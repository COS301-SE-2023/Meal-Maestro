# Meal Maestro

## The Fellowship

The proposed app is a cross-platform mobile application that uses advanced data
associations to generate weekly meal plans based on a user's dietary preferences and
requirements, it aims to combat decision fatigue by providing an easy-to-use AI copilot that
seamlessly integrates into a user's weekly routine. Users can view nutritional details and
ingredients for each meal and generate a grocery list based on the ingredients needed and
also includes optional features such as dietary goal tracking, meal ratings, ingredient
substitutions, budget preferences and gives users the ability to add ingredients to their
virtual pantry through image recognition. It aims to reduce decision fatigue, helps users
easily plan meals for the coming week and helps them hit their nutritional goals.
